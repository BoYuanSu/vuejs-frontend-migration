# Assignment - Migrate JavaScript / jQuery to Vue

## Scenario

There is a legacy system written in PHP without any framework and the codes are quite messy.  
After a long deliberation, team leader decides to use `Vue` as the front-end framework for better development experience.  

You are now an employee of the company, as a front-end engineer, your first mission is to do the code refactoring and try to migrate the existed functions written in JavaScript / jQuery to `Vue`.

## Target

* Extract CSS and JavaScript `into external files`. You can decide folder structure to store files.
* Migrate existed JavaScript / jQuery functions to `Vue` with version `2.x`.
* (Optional) Use one of the tools to manage static files. `Webpack`, `Bowel`

## Deliverable

* Upload codes to your `Github` and `provide repo URL`.
* (Optional) Host your codes on any cloud service, e.g. `Heroku`, `Amazon Web Serivce (AWS)`, `Microsoft Azure`, `Google Cloud Platform (GCP)`, and provide site URL.   
  If you are using `AWS` / `Azure` / `GCP`, describe what services you use.

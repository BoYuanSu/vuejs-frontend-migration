# Assignment - Migrate legacy frontend to Vue

## Scenario

After a long deliberation, team leader decides to use __Vue__ as the frontend framework for better development experience.  

You are now an employee of the company, as a front-end engineer, your first mission is to do the code refactoring and try to migrate the existed functions written in JavaScript / jQuery to __Vue__.

## Target

1. Extract CSS and JavaScript __into external files__. You can decide folder structure to store them.
2. Migrate existed JavaScript / jQuery functions to __Vue__ with version __2.x__.
3. Use __Vue__ to read json file instead of PHP.
4. (Optional) Use one of the frontend tools to manage static files. For example, use __Webpack__ or __Bower__ to manage __bootstrap__ and __jQuery__.

## Deliverable

1. Upload codes to your __Github__ and __provide repo URL__.
2. (Optional) Host your codes on any cloud service, e.g. __Heroku__, __Amazon Web Serivce (AWS)__, __Microsoft Azure__, __Google Cloud Platform (GCP)__, and provide site URL.   
  If you are using __AWS__ / __Azure__ / __GCP__, describe what services you use.
